# Development Learnings and Patterns

## Session Context (2025-08-21)

### Repository Onboarding Completed
- Comprehensive analysis of mermaid-playground repository structure
- Documented technical architecture and development workflow
- Identified current feature implementation status
- Created repository memory documentation system

## Technical Discoveries

### Build System Architecture
- **Custom Build Script**: Uses Node.js with HTTPS module for CDN resource downloading
- **Production Optimization**: Inlines all external dependencies for single-file deployment
- **CSS Strategy**: Replaces Tailwind CDN with custom CSS for GitHub Pages compatibility
- **Module System**: Recently migrated from CommonJS to ES modules (build.js updated)

### Vue 3 Implementation Patterns
- **Composition API**: Pure Composition API usage without Options API
- **TypeScript Integration**: Comprehensive type definitions for all external libraries
- **Reactive State**: Efficient use of `ref()` and `computed()` for state management
- **Template Refs**: Direct DOM manipulation for D3.js integration

### Development Workflow Insights
- **Testing Strategy**: Multi-layered approach with HTML validation, TypeScript checking, and accessibility testing
- **Quality Gates**: Strict ESLint configuration with zero warnings policy
- **Build Targets**: Separate development and production build processes
- **Package Management**: pnpm-first approach with engine requirements

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths Identified
- Excellent TypeScript coverage with strict configuration
- Comprehensive accessibility testing with pa11y
- Clean separation between presentation and business logic
- Efficient build process with dependency inlining

### Potential Improvements
- **Modern Build Tools**: Could benefit from Vite migration for better DX
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest would provide better testing experience
- **Component Architecture**: Currently single-file, could benefit from component splitting
- **Performance Optimizations**: Worker-based compilation for large diagrams

## Architecture Patterns

### State Management
```typescript
// Reactive state with computed properties
const code = ref<string>('');
const autoCompile = ref<boolean>(true);
const isDarkMode = computed(() => theme.value === 'dark');
```

### Event Handling
```typescript
// Debounced rendering for performance
let renderTimeout: number;
const debounceRender = (): void => {
  clearTimeout(renderTimeout);
  renderTimeout = window.setTimeout(renderDiagram, 500);
};
```

### D3.js Integration
```typescript
// SVG enhancement with zoom and pan
const enhanceWithD3 = (): void => {
  const svg: D3Selection = window.d3.select('#app').select('svg');
  const zoom: D3ZoomBehavior = window.d3.zoom()
    .scaleExtent([0.1, 3])
    .on('zoom', (event) => {
      svg.select('g').attr('transform', event.transform);
    });
};
```

## Development Environment Notes

### Package Manager Configuration
- **Engine Requirements**: Node.js 22+, Python 3.11+
- **pnpm Usage**: Required for dependency management
- **Development Server**: Python HTTP server on port 8000

### Build Process
1. TypeScript compilation (`tsc`)
2. Custom build script with CDN resource inlining
3. CSS optimization and Tailwind replacement
4. Single HTML file output for deployment

## Performance Considerations

### Current Optimizations
- Debounced diagram rendering (500ms)
- Manual compilation toggle for large diagrams
- CDN resource inlining for production
- SVG-based output for scalability

### Identified Bottlenecks
- Synchronous diagram compilation blocks UI
- Large diagram rendering can cause browser lag
- No caching mechanism for compiled diagrams

## Security and Accessibility

### Security Measures
- No inline scripts in production build
- Vue.js template XSS protection
- Trusted CDN sources only
- Client-side only operation

### Accessibility Features
- pa11y automated testing
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible markup
- High contrast theme support

## Future Enhancement Roadmap

### Immediate Improvements (Low Effort, High Impact)
1. Vite migration for better development experience
2. Latest dependency updates
3. Vitest testing framework integration
4. Component splitting for better maintainability

### Medium-term Enhancements
1. Web Workers for diagram compilation
2. Diagram caching system
3. Additional export formats
4. Real-time collaboration features

### Long-term Vision
1. Plugin system for custom diagram types
2. Cloud save/sync functionality
3. Advanced theming system
4. Performance monitoring integration
